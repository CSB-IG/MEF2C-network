Red links are interactions from MEF2C to the molecular signature.
Green links connect the molecular signature to the rest of the genome.
Pale yellow are third degree interactions. The peripheric histogram
shews log fold change in expression levels: pale grey for
overexpressed, dark gray for underexpressed.
